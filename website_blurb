Why are we Daydream Believers?

"To help young people see that data roles are creative roles."

We are daydream believers because we want to help young poeple discover that data jobs are inherently creative jobs, and we want to be part of the team that helps teach creative problem solving as a core skill. 

Data is not all about maths and spreadsheets; it involves a lot of creativity in order to tell effective stories and gain insight from data. And it doesn't even matter what kind of data! Data is part of every single job, and we want to raise awareness that you can have a creative data career in any area you love. 


Our Classes:

We'd like you to help us explore an important data problem in a creative way. The world is in a climate crisis, and a big problem the planet has is pollution. To help solve this, we need data on how people travel to school. Your challenge is to collect some data from your class, and come up with a creative way to show the results.
